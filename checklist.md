# Checklists

## Accessibility questions
To ask of the venue & make sure we advertise on the meetup event.

1. Can the event space be accessed by a wheelchair?
2. Are there any steps or inclines between the street, the event space and the toilets?
3. Are there lifts? Do they announce the floor numbers?
4. Do the doors have push buttons to open them?
5. Are the toilets large enough for a wheelchair? Do they have grab rails, cord alarms and lowered sinks?
6. Can we advertise a contact number for the venue in case people have specific questions?

Really good example:
> Access to the building is via two ramps which lead to double glass front doors, which are accessible by push pad. The Auditorium is on the first floor and accessed by either stairs or lift. The lift is large and spacious and does have a grab rail and alarm button. The lift also features spoken messages indicating which floor the lift is on and whether the doors are opening or closing. Within the building there are call buttons for assistance if required. Accessible toilets are on both the ground and first floor. They both have grab rails, cord alarms and lowered sinks. For further specific access information, please contact [venue name] on [phone number]
